All automated tests are located under the `tests/` directory. The test suite uses basic `curl` commands and shell scripting.

### Included Test Scenarios

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test_get_root_405`    | Validates that a GET request to `/` returns a `405 Method Not Allowed`.     |
| `test_post_name`       | Sends your candidate name via POST and expects a base64 token in response. |
| `test_cookie_access`   | Sends a GET request to `/instructions` using the token as a cookie.         |

To run the tests:

```bash
bash tests/test_api_challenge.sh

Make sure `curl` is installed and that you're connected to the internet.
